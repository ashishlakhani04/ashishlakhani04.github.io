In case of odd number of teams, a team would be given a bye and promoted to next round based on a lottery and points would be awarded accordingly. The winners of each round would be promoted to next round to compete with each other. The number of rounds will be based on the number of participants.
For example if there are 20 teams, 10 groups would be competing in the first round. The 10 winners would be divided in 5 groups to compete against each other. Now amongst the 5 winners, one of the teams would be given a bye and remaining  2 groups would compete among themselves. Out of the 3 teams progressing to this round (1 bye and 2 winners), one would again be given a bye and promoted to the next round i.e. the final round and the remaining two teams would compete in order to face the team already promoted to the final round.
